**Slide 1: Project Overview**  
**Capstone Project - API Analysis: Behavioral Malware Detection Using Machine Learning**  
- **By:** Dileep Tiku  
- **Program:** Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree (June 11, 2016)  
- **Problem Statement:** Develop a behavior analysis model to classify API call sequences as malicious or benign to identify bad actors.  
- **Dataset:** CSMining dataset with 388 software traces (320 malware, 68 benign).  
- **Motivation:** Traditional signature-based malware detection has limitations. Machine learning can enhance API analysis by examining behavioral patterns in API calls.  
  
**Slide 2: Approach & Algorithm Choices**  
**Feature Extraction:**  
- **CountVectorizer:** Converts API call sequences into numerical vectors using the Bag-of-Words model.  
- **TF-IDF Transformer:** Reduces the importance of common API calls across malicious and benign sequences.  
  
**Classification Algorithm:**  
- **Chosen Model:** Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).  
- **Reasoning:**  
  - SVM performs well for sequence-based classification problems.  
  - SGD optimization efficiently handles large-scale API call sequences.  
  - Linear separability assumption holds for textual API call data.  
  
**Slide 3: Results & Conclusion**  
- **Benchmark:** MultiNomial Na√Øve Bayes (84.6% accuracy).  
- **Final Model Performance:** SVM with SGD achieved **89.7% accuracy**.  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Accuracy.  
- **Next Steps:**  
  - Expand behavioral analysis to detect API call anomalies indicating malicious intent.  
  - Integrate network-based behavioral analysis (outbound calls to blacklisted URLs).  
  - Extend classification to differentiate attack patterns (data exfiltration, unauthorized access, API abuse).  
- **Key Takeaway:** Behavioral API analysis using machine learning is a powerful approach for enhancing API analysis and detecting bad actors.
